What I have Done So far.

linter ---> eslint
webframework ----> express
unit test framwork ---> mocha chai
logger ---> winston


Implemented a basic-intermediate kind of file structure
-- App
 -- controllers
 -- data-loader
 -- routes
 -- services

 The Dublin Bike Dataset will be loaded on the App start itself.And will be a  singleton Object so that the 
 operations such as delete,add and update can be done consistently.

 Integrated the winston logger
 created a RequestHandler class inorder to reduce the repetition of the code and to have an overall consistency on the response


 both GET and POST API will work ---

 If I had more time 

 I would have done the
            Filter --> validating both the operands for example:if the property that is to filtered is Date then Parsing it and then filtering.    
            express request-validations.
            unit testing
            and of course the remaing part of the assessment :)
            Thank you
